# Birthday Fact Generator
We have decided to create an application which generates random facts based on user input. Our theme of choice was historical facts based around your own date of birth or a date that you consider significant. This allows users to find out interesting facts based on any given date they wish in a simple and interactive way using a random fact generating API. The API works with Wikipedia to draw out facts based on any of the three user preferences, those being Births, Deaths, or Events. The user is given the option to choose one of the three categories after entering in their desired date and they can randomly generate countless facts.
